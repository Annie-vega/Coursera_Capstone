In order to define what \"trendy, vibrant and young\" means I have some ideas regarding the type of shops that should be in the area, the rent prices, the market forecasts and the \"top of mind\" places in my city for a business like mine.\n",

After comparing the results of the selected neighborhoods and other random zones as benchmark, it was clear that the strategy was dominant.\n",
